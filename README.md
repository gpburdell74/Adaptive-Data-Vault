# Adaptive-Data-Vault

This application is a general password management system that relies on the user supplying a user id, password, and PIN number in order to encrypt and decrypt the data content.  Each individual file must be logged into seperately.  This is a work in progress, and represents a pre-Alpha state of the application.  

This also relies on content from the Adaptive Intelligence Framework repository.
